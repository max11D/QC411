# QC411 - A Directory of Queens College
This repository is intented to act as a crowdsourced directory of Queens College bureaucracy, clubs and student organizations. It shall provide an overview of the organizations, their leadership, and any *public* contact information. 

While Git isn't the most accessible way to crowdsource a directory, it's the most transparent solution. Forks are also welcomed **and encouraged.**

To keep things safe, we will generally only include Queens College phone numbers of the form (718) 997-xxxx. _**Please**_ ask for consent before adding people's personal emails and social media handles.
